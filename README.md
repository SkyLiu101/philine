# philine

Philine is a interactive rhythm game that could be played via keyboard.

Idea: 
- Each rhythm line binds with a key.
- Notes spawn on rhythm lines.
- Lines are straight, no verticle/horizontal constraints.
- Click corresponding key when note reach bottom of rhythm line
- Thats it!

Please enjoy
